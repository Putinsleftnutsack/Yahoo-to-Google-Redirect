Yahoo is fucking annoying and automatically sets itself as the main search engine on your browser, even after setting google as the main search engine and deleting yahoo as an option, this is often still the case.
This extension automatically sets you back to google if the search query includes https://search.yahoo.com/.
I hope this helps you :)
